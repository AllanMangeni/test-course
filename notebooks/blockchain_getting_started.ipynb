        "Blockchain is a chronological database of transactions recorded by a network of computers; it is a list (‘chain’) of groups (‘blocks’) of transactions faciliated through this decentralised public ledger - also known as distributed ledger technology (DLT).\n",
        "Blockchain ledger combines cryptographic mechanism, data management, networking, and incentive mechanisms that rewards the checking, execution, and recording of transactions between them different parties of the network.<br>\n",
        "Every new transaction executed on the ledger carries both an immutable record of the entire history of the chain and all the previous transactions. Anyone can add a transaction to it; noone can remove it.\n",
        "\n",
        "![blockchain-basics](blockchain-basics.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "Basically, blockchain is a public ledger containing the list of all historical transactions that happened since its inception; each node on the network records new transactions on its copy of the ledger and then propagates the information to all the nodes it is connected to (hence peer to peer). Put simply, it is basically a distributed database which nodes contain a copy of the ledger of all transactions. This allows the processing nodes to independently validate of the authenticity of the transactions without the need for middleman or central authority, with the content of the blocks replicated across many geographically-distributed processing nodes. The system is said **trustless**. All participants of the network – all the other devices that hold the same version of a block – eventually achieve **consensus** about the integrity and shared contents of the blockchain ledger, by solving a complex mathematical problem; the node at the origin of the successfull computation gets a *reward*.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Historically, transactions between parties such as payments, escrow, notarisation, voting, registration, and process coordination– key to government and industry operations – are supported by trusted third-parties such as public private agencies, banks, legal firms, accounting firms, and service providers. About being trustless, **blockchain consensus** is designed so that instead of trusting these intermediaries, trust would be given to a majority of the collective jointly operating the blockchain, and the correctness of their shared technology platform.\n",

        "\n",
        "By 1 January 2011, 1 BTC equaled USD 0.30, with a total market cap above USD 1 million. 2011 saw the creation of other cryptocurrencies -also known known as *altcoins*, or *alternative coins* (including *litecoin*). These are branchs of BTC cryptocurrency, *forked* from its open source code and intended to improve certain elements of the Bitcoin design such as, but not limited to, speed or anonymity.<br>\n",

        "The increasing popularity of crytocurrencies led to the creation of online infrastructures to enable users to trade and store their coins, with the first Bitcoin exchanges being launched. Along with it *online black markets* available on the *dark web* also gained traction, where contraband items were traded against sole payment with Bitcoin -due to its pseudo-anonymity. This might explain why for a relatively long period of time was bitcoin linked to illegal and or criminal activity. It has since evolved beyond this limited scope.<br>\n",

        "2012 saw the first use of cryptocurrency as a form of payment at legitimate online merchants platform. The first major website to accept payment in Bitcoin was WordPress, followed shortly by other retailers including Microsoft. This move from such a major actor was considered to be the first step towards widely accepting Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as a legitimate international payment method. By the end of 2012 Bitcoin value was over $13. More altcoins -among which Ripple, a cryptocurrency that does not require mining, thus with much faster transaction times than Bitcoin- were developed that year.<br/>\n",
        "\n",
        "2013 was the year when bitcoin got closer to being truly mainstream. Research suggests that this substantial growth was, at least partly, linked to the increasing number of online vendors ready to accept it as a currency; market manipulation -most likely through artificial trading between two bots operating on the [Mt Gox](\twww.mtgox.com) exchange- may have also been the other reason. Initial Coin Offering (ICO) started that year, the first one being held by Masterocin, a means of crowdfunding cryptocurrencies that had since proved to be controversial due to the lack of regulatory oversight placed on them. For that same reason, ICOs have today been completely banned by a number of countries. "
