        "In brief, blockchain is a public ledger containing the list of all historical transactions that happened since its inception. Put simply, it is basically a distributed database which nodes contain a copy of the ledger of all transactions. This allows the processing nodes to independently validate of the authenticity of the transactions without the need for middleman or central authority, with the content of the blocks replicated across many geographically-distributed processing nodes. The system is said **trustless**. All participants of the network – all the other devices that hold the same version of a block – eventually achieve **consensus** about the integrity and shared contents of the blockchain ledger, by solving a complex mathematical problem; the node at the origin of the successfull computation gets a *reward*.\n",

About being trustless, **blockchain consensus** is designed so that instead of trusting these intermediaries, trust would be given to a majority of the collective jointly operating the blockchain, and the correctness of their shared technology platform.\n",

Transactions are recorded into a distributed, replicated public database known as the blockchain, with consensus achieved by a proof-of-work system called \"mining\". It is the process of creating new blockchain blocks using computing power to record transactions in blocks on the chain. ‘Proof of Work’ (PoW) mining uses computing power to solve the cryptographic algorithms necessary to record the transactions, leading to rewarding the successful miners.<br>\n",
